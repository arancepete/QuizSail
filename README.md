# QuizSail

Test Prep Engineâ€”Run a live version at [www.quizsail.com](https://www.quizsail.com/).

### QuizSail contains a 240+ bank of questions for WGU C857 Software QA and a 700+ bank for WGU C191 Operating Systems.

The test prep engine uses a technique called *assumed competency*.  This technique assumes that if you answer the question correctly the first time that you already know the answer. Because of this, it's running on sort of an honor system, so if the user is not sure what the answer is they should not enter any answer at all instead of guessing.

QuizSail's competency system works by holding a certain number of questions from the pool in-flight.  Once the user has correctly answered a question in the in-flight state so many times in a row, the question is moved to the completed state and is not asked again.  As long as the in-flight pool is full, the next question to appear is randomly selected from the questions in the pool that aged the most so that the same question is not likely to be asked twice in a row.
